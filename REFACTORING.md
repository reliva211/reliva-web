# Profile Page Refactoring

## Overview

The profile page has been refactored to improve maintainability, fix the search blinking issue, and enhance debugging capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Search Blinking Issue

- **Problem**: Search was triggering on every keystroke, causing UI flickering
- **Solution**: Implemented debounced search with `useSearch` hook
- **Debounce delay**: 500ms with minimum query length of 2 characters

### 2. Code Organization

- **Before**: 1104 lines in a single file with mixed concerns
- **After**: Separated into multiple focused components and hooks

### 3. New Components Created

#### `useSearch` Hook (`hooks/use-search.ts`)

- Handles debounced search functionality
- Manages search state (query, results, loading, errors)
- Configurable debounce delay and minimum query length
- Provides clear search functionality

#### `searchService` (`lib/search-service.ts`)

- Centralized API service for TMDB and Google Books
- Handles all external API calls
- Proper error handling and type safety
- Reusable across components

#### `SearchModal` Component (`components/search-modal.tsx`)

- Extracted from the main profile page
- Generic search modal for movies, series, books, and music
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better type safety with generics

#### `useCollections` Hook (`hooks/use-collections.ts`)

- Manages user collections (movies, series, books)
- Handles Firebase operations
- Provides section filtering functionality
- Centralized collection state management

#### `CollectionSection` Component (`components/collection-section.tsx`)

- Reusable component for displaying collection sections
- Configurable grid layout and icons
- Consistent empty state handling
- Supports ratings and special icons

#### `ErrorBoundary` Component (`components/error-boundary.tsx`)

- Catches and displays React errors gracefully
- Development mode shows detailed error information
- Provides recovery options (retry, refresh)

#### `DebugPanel` Component (`components/debug-panel.tsx`)

- Development-only debug panel
- Shows real-time state information
- Helps with debugging search and collection issues

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- API errors are properly caught and displayed
- Search errors show user-friendly messages
- Error boundary prevents complete app crashes
- Development mode shows detailed error information

### 5. Better State Management

- Separated concerns into focused hooks
- Reduced prop drilling
- Clearer data flow
- Better separation of UI and business logic

## Benefits

### Performance

- Debounced search reduces API calls
- Better component re-rendering optimization
- Reduced bundle size through code splitting

### Maintainability

- Smaller, focused components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable hooks and components
- Better type safety

### Debugging

- Debug panel for development
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Better error messages and logging
- Real-time state inspection

### User Experience

- No more search blinking
- Smoother search experience
- Better error feedback
- Consistent UI patterns

## Usage

### Search Functionality

```typescript
const movieSearch = useSearch(
  (query: string) => searchService.searchMovies(query),
  { debounceMs: 500, minQueryLength: 2 }
);
```

### Collection Management

```typescript
const { movies, addMovie, getMoviesBySection } = useCollections(userId);
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ProfilePage />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Development Tools

### Debug Panel

- Click the "Debug" button in the bottom-right corner
- View real-time state information
- Only available in development mode

### Error Boundary

- Catches React errors
- Shows detailed error information in development
- Provides recovery options

## API Integration

### TMDB API

- Movie and series search
- Proper error handling
- Rate limiting consideration

### Google Books API

- Book search functionality
- Error handling for missing API keys

### Firebase

- User collections management
- Real-time data synchronization
- Proper error handling

## Future Improvements

1. **Spotify Integration**: Add music search functionality
2. **Caching**: Implement search result caching
3. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large collections
4. **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities
5. **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
6. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
