# Following System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a following system to the Reliva platform, allowing users to follow other users and see only their reviews in their personalized feed.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useFollowedReviews`
- **File**: `hooks/use-followed-reviews.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fetches reviews only from users that the current user follows
- **Features**:
  - Gets the current user's following list from Firestore
  - Fetches reviews from all followed users
  - Sorts reviews by timestamp (most recent first)
  - Limits to 5 most recent reviews per user, 20 total
  - Handles loading states and errors

### 2. Updated Home Page
- **Files**: `app/home/page.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed trending movies and series sections
  - Replaced with "Reviews from People You Follow" section
  - Added buttons to find people to follow and write reviews
  - Shows appropriate empty states when no following or no reviews
  - Added error handling for failed review fetching

### 3. Database Structure
The following system uses the existing user data structure in Firestore:

```javascript
// User document structure
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  username: string,
  fullName: string,
  followers: string[], // Array of user IDs who follow this user
  following: string[], // Array of user IDs this user follows
  createdAt: timestamp
}

// Review document structure (unchanged)
{
  userId: string, // ID of the user who wrote the review
  userDisplayName: string,
  mediaId: string,
  mediaTitle: string,
  mediaType: "movie" | "series" | "book" | "music",
  rating: number,
  reviewText: string,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. Test Data Script
- **File**: `scripts/add-test-following-data.js`
- **Purpose**: Adds test users and reviews to demonstrate the following system
- **Usage**: Run with `node scripts/add-test-following-data.js`

## How It Works

### 1. Following Users
- Users can search for other users on the `/users` page
- Click "Follow" to follow a user
- This updates both users' `followers` and `following` arrays in Firestore

### 2. Personalized Feed
- The home page now shows only reviews from followed users
- Reviews are sorted by timestamp (most recent first)
- If user has no following, shows helpful message to find people
- If followed users have no reviews, shows message to write first review

### 3. Real-time Updates
- The `useFollowedReviews` hook automatically refreshes when the user changes
- This ensures the feed updates when users follow/unfollow others

## User Experience

### For New Users
1. Sign up for an account
2. Go to `/users` to find people to follow
3. Follow some users to start seeing their reviews
4. Write your own reviews to share with your followers

### For Existing Users
1. Your home page now shows only reviews from people you follow
2. Use the "Find People" button to discover new users
3. Follow more people to expand your feed
4. Write reviews to share with your followers

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience**: Users only see content from people they care about
2. **Reduced Noise**: No more random reviews from unknown users
3. **Social Discovery**: Encourages users to find and follow others
4. **Engagement**: Users are more likely to interact with content from people they follow

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Considerations
- Reviews are fetched in parallel for all followed users
- Limited to 5 reviews per user to prevent overwhelming the feed
- Total limit of 20 reviews to keep the page fast
- Client-side sorting to avoid complex Firestore queries

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing user data
- Error states for failed API calls
- Loading states for better UX
- Fallback messages for empty states

### Scalability
- The current implementation works well for users with <100 following
- For larger scale, consider:
  - Pagination for reviews
  - Server-side aggregation
  - Caching strategies
  - Background job processing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notifications**: Notify users when someone they follow posts a review
2. **Feed Algorithm**: Prioritize reviews based on user preferences
3. **Following Suggestions**: Recommend users to follow based on interests
4. **Feed Filters**: Allow filtering by media type, rating, etc.
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live feed updates
