# Profile Picture Compression Fix

## Problem

Profile pictures were appearing compressed in the profile section due to the `aspect-square` CSS class forcing all images to be square, regardless of their natural aspect ratio.

## Solution

Updated the `AvatarImage` component in `components/ui/avatar.tsx` to use `object-cover` instead of `aspect-square` for natural image display.

### Before:

```tsx
<AvatarPrimitive.Image
  ref={ref}
  className={cn("aspect-square h-full w-full", className)}
  {...props}
/>
```

### After:

```tsx
<AvatarPrimitive.Image
  ref={ref}
  className={cn("h-full w-full object-cover", className)}
  {...props}
/>
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Natural Aspect Ratio**: Profile pictures now display in their natural aspect ratio instead of being forced into a square
2. **Better Image Quality**: Images are no longer compressed or distorted
3. **Consistent Display**: All avatar components across the app now display images naturally
4. **Circular Container**: Images still fit properly within the circular avatar container

## Components Affected

- ✅ `app/profile/page.tsx` - Main profile page
- ✅ `app/users/[id]/page.tsx` - Public profile page
- ✅ `components/user-profile.tsx` - User profile component
- ✅ `components/user-avatar.tsx` - User avatar component
- ✅ All other components using the Avatar component

## Technical Details

- **`object-cover`**: Ensures the image covers the entire container while maintaining aspect ratio
- **`h-full w-full`**: Makes the image fill the container completely
- **Circular clipping**: The parent `Avatar` component with `rounded-full` class handles the circular shape
- **No compression**: Images are no longer forced into square dimensions

## Result

Profile pictures now display naturally without compression, showing users' actual photos as they intended them to look.
